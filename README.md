# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Dataset-Terrorism-

Hello Connections! 👋🌟

I hope you're all doing well. Today, I want to share some exciting news and insights from a recent exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a terrorism dataset. Here are the key takeaways:

1. *Data Import and Cleaning:* ✅🔍 Successfully imported the dataset and performed initial data cleaning by renaming columns, dropping missing values, and handling missing numerical values by filling them with zeros. #DataCleaning #ImportSuccess

2. *Yearly Analysis:* 📊📈 Visualized the number of terrorist activities each year using a countplot. This plot shows how the frequency of terrorist attacks has evolved over the years. The number of attacks seems to have increased in recent years. #YearlyAnalysis #TerrorismTrends

3. *Monthly Analysis:* 📅📉 Also visualized the number of attacks by month. It appears that some months have a higher frequency of attacks than others. #MonthlyAnalysis #AttackPatterns

4. *Regional Analysis:* 🌍🗺️ The plot that shows terrorist activities by region over the years provides insights into how different regions have been affected by terrorism. This can help in understanding the geographical distribution of attacks. #RegionalAnalysis #GeographicalInsights

5. *Casualties Analysis:* ☠️⚰️ Calculated the total casualties (sum of killed and wounded) and created a heatmap to show which countries have the highest casualties for each year. This heatmap can help identify trends and countries with high casualty rates. #CasualtiesAnalysis #Heatmap

6. *Most Affected Regions:* 🌆📊 Created a countplot to visualize the regions most affected by terrorist attacks. This provides an overview of which regions have experienced the highest number of attacks. #MostAffectedRegions #TerrorismImpact

7. *Target Analysis:* 🏢🎯 Mentioned that "Private Citizens and Property" is the most frequently targeted category. It would be helpful to visualize this data to understand the distribution of attacks across different target types. #TargetAnalysis #AttackTargets

Feel free to dive into the details, and if you have any questions or need further analysis, please don't hesitate to ask. Let's continue exploring this dataset together! 👍📈🔍 #DataAnalysis #TerrorismDataset
